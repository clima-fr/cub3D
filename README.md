## Overview

This project is a simplified implementation of a RayCaster, adhering to the `cub3D` project curriculum of 42 school. This was carried out following the rules described in the [`subject`]() version 10 released 2023.

## Mandatory Features

1. Must use the miniLibX.
2. Window management (e.g., changing to another window, minimizing, etc).
3. Implement close the window and quit the program cleanly (`ESC` and `X`)
4. Read, interpret and validate the map from a .cub file.
5. Ensure that the map consists of only 6 possible characters (`0`, `1`, `N`, `S`, `E` and `W`).
6. Handle identifiers and all yours specific information on map.
7. Display different wall textures for each cardinal direction (`NO`, `SO`, `EA`, `WE`).
8. Define distinct colors for the floor and ceiling.
9. Handle player movement within the field of view (`A`, `W`, `S` and `D`).
10. Implement rotation of the field of view(‚¨ÖÔ∏è and ‚û°Ô∏è).
12. Display the type of any errors in the program on stdout.
13. Apply raycaster engine calculations.

## Compilation and Execution
